![Project Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150x150?text=Your+Logo+Here)

## Overview

This project is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to implement security using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It includes user authentication and authorization functionalities, providing a robust security framework for your application.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login using JWT.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Restrict access to endpoints based on user roles.
- **Spring Security**: Comprehensive security configuration with JWT.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for easy testing and development.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend application.
- **Spring Security**: For handling authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For stateless authentication.
- **H2 Database**: Lightweight database for development and testing.
